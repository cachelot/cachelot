# What is Cachelot Library #
If your application needs an LRU cache that works at the speed of light. That's what the Cachelot library is.

The library works with a fixed pre-allocated memory. You tell the memory size and LRU cache is ready.

Small metadata, up to 98% memory utilization.

Besides memory management, Cachelot ensures smooth responsiveness, without any "gaps" for both read and write operations.

Cachelot can work as a consistent cache, returning an error when out of memory or evicting old items to free space for new ones.

The code is highly optimized C++. You can use cachelot on platforms where resources are limited, like IoT devices or handheld; as well, as on servers with tons of RAM.

All this allows you to store and access three million items per second (depending on the CPU cache size). Maybe 3MOPs doesn't sound like such a large number, but it means ~333 nanoseconds are spent on a single operation, while RAM reference cost is at [~100 nanoseconds](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~rcs/research/interactive_latency.html).
Only 3 RAM reference per request, can you compete with that?

There are benchmarks inside of repo; we encourage you to try them for yourself.

It is possible to create bindings and use cachelot from your programming language of choice: Python, Go, Java, etc.

# What is Cachelot Distributed Cache Server #
Think of [Memcached](http://memcached.org) but Cachelot far better utilizes RAM so you can store more items in the same amount of memory. Also Cachelot is faster in terms of latency.
[See benchmarks](http://cachelot.io/index.html#benchmarks) on the cachelot web site.

Cachelot is single-threaded. It can scale to 1024 cores, and run even on battery-powered devices.

Cachelot supports TCP, UDP, and Unix sockets.

The easiest way to play with cachelot is to run Docker container

    $ docker run --net=host cachelot/cachelot

Then you can connect to the port 11211 and speak memcached protocol

    $ telnet localhost 11211
    >set test 0 0 16
    >Hello, cachelot!
    STORED
    >get test
    VALUE test 0 16
    Hello, cachelot!
    END
    >quit

## Cross-platform ##
Cachelot is tested on Alpine Linux (Docker), CentOS 7, Ubuntu Trusty, macOS and Windows 10/11.

32bit ARM and x86-64 supported.

## How To Hack ##

### Prerequisites ###

 * C++11 capable compiler ([gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/), [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/) or [MSVC](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/fr/vs/features/cplusplus/))
 * [Boost libraries](http://boost.org/)
 * [CMake](http://cmake.org/)
 * optionally [Doxygen](http://doxygen.org/) to build docs
 * For windows:
   * [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/) for Boost
   * [Python Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) or embedded Python in Visual Studio for test scripts

### Build ###

Clone source code repository:

    $ git clone https://github.com/cachelot/cachelot.git

Next

    $ cd cachelot

Generate project files for your favorite IDE or Makefile by running `cmake -G "{target}"` in the cachelot root directory.

For example (Linux):

    $ cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    $ make

or (macOS):

    $ cmake -G "Xcode" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    $ make

or (Windows):

    C:\> cmake -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    C:\> cmake --build .
        OR
    C:\> msbuild ALL_BUILD.vcxproj

There are several variants of build:

`-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`  must be one of the:
- `Debug` - enable debug messages, assertions and disable optimization
- `Release` - release build
- `RelWithDebInfo` - release build with debug information enabled
- `MinSizeRel` - minimal size release
- `AddressSanitizer` - special build to run under [Address Sanitizer](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html) (compiler support and libasan required)
- `UBSanitizer` - special build to run under [Undefined Behavior Sanitizer](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.html) (compiler support required)

Dedicated script are available to respectively `clean` and `build all` configurations:

Linux and macOS:

    $ ./cleanup.sh
    $ ./all_build.sh

Windows:

    C:\> cleanup.bat
    C:\> all_build.bat

### Windows specificity ###
Additional libraries under Windows have to be installed and declared one by one.
To do that Microsoft proposes a dedicated tool named `vcpkg` which is in charge of downloading, compiling and deploying libraries like Boost.

vcpkg have to installed on the computer to be able to install libraries.
Follow these [instructions](https://vcpkg.io/en/getting-started.html) to download and install vcpkg.

After installation, run the command `vcpkg integrate install` to integrate vcpkg in the system (**required admin privieges**).

Then, vcpkg is ready to be used with Visual Studio and CMake. If the vcpkg installation folder is for example `c:\vcpkg\` the CMake toolchain could be completed like:

`-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=c:/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake`

Note: The script `all_build.bat` automatically detect vcpkg installation folder.

### Run tests or benchmarks ###
All binaries (main executable, unit tests, etc.) will be in `bin/{build_type}`.

Dedicated test script if available for automatically run the tests:

Linux and macOS:

    $ ./run_tests.sh

Windows:

    C:\> run_tests.bat
